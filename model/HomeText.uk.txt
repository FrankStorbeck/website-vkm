In Schoorl, about 45 km North West from Amsterdam, our holiday house 'Mimi' is for rent.
It is situated behind our house but lies completely free from it. We live at a very quiet
little street that a little further on turns into a bicycle path leading you directly to the
dunes.

The house has an entry hall, a living room, an open kitchen, upstairs two bedrooms for two
persons each and a children's bed on the landing. Next there is a bathroom with shower,
toilet and washing machine. Sheets for the beds are present. With a WiFi adapter in your
computer you can connect to the Internet. The house has a central heating system and is
pleasantly isolated. There is a terrace and the children can use the swings.
When you like you can use the sauna of the holiday house. There is a large bathtub for
cooling down and an outside shower with cold and warm water and a nice view on the dunes.

The house is located within a 5 minutes walk to the dunes. The sea is about 5 kilometres more
to the West
and can be reached on foot or by bicycle. When preferred you can also visit the sea by car or
public transport at Camperduin, located five kilometres to the North-West.

You can rent the holiday house from € 100,- per night.

The costs for gas, water and electricity are enclosed. The rent must be paid in advance. At
your arrival we ask for a deposit of  € 200. It will be returned when you are leaving under
subtraction of the cleaning costs and the tourist tax. There are no reservation costs.

To offer every guest a pleasant stay, smoking within the holiday house is not allowed.
For the same reason we cannot allow pets to stay in the house.
